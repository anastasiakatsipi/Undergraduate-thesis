Title:
Design and Development of a Web-Based Project Management Application

Description:
This thesis focuses on the design and development of a modern web-based project management system intended to support users in organizing, tracking, and collaborating on personal or team projects. The application provides a structured environment where users can create projects, define tasks, assign responsibilities, monitor progress, and maintain an activity history.

The system integrates a secure authentication mechanism, ensuring that each user can access and manage only their own data or any shared projects they have been invited to. A relational database is used to store projects, tasks, user information, permissions, and activity logs, enabling efficient data retrieval and seamless collaboration between multiple users. The backend architecture follows contemporary web development practices, offering RESTful API endpoints for data management and enforcing role-based access control for shared projects.

On the frontend, the application offers an intuitive and responsive user interface, designed to provide a clear overview of project status, deadlines, and task dependencies. Modern JavaScript frameworks and UI libraries are utilized to deliver a smooth and interactive experience.

The thesis includes the full development lifecycle—requirements analysis, architectural design, database modeling, implementation, testing, and evaluation of the system. Additionally, it discusses the technologies employed, the challenges encountered during development, and the potential improvements for future expansion.

This work demonstrates how web technologies can be combined to build scalable, secure, and user-friendly systems that address real-world needs in task management and collaboration.
